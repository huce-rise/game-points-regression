# CSPointsPredictor
A regression project to predict player points in Counter-Strike matches using a custom Linear Regression model built from scratch with Gradient Descent.

## Overview
- **Objective**: Predict the points variable based on match and player performance metrics (e.g., kills, deaths, map, etc.).

- **Model**: Custom Linear Regression implemented without scikit-learn's regression module.

- **Data**: Requires a CSV file (match_data.csv) with columns like map, points, kills, deaths, etc.

- **Feature**: Includes engineered features such as kd_ratio (kill-death ratio) and total_rounds.
